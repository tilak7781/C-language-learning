# C-language-learning
What is C:
C is one of the fastest programming language as it is close to low-level languages such as Assembly language. If you are already familiar with programming, then you must know the demand out there for a C programmer. Because C comes in handy in case of all the applications that require fast processing, such as games, or major parts of different operating systems.

Benefits of C:
C was developed in early 1970’s but it is still in much demand and it doesn’t seem it is going anywhere, there are a lot of reasons for that such as:

C takes only significant CPU time for interpretation. That is why a lot Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc. are built using C.
Being close to Machine language, some of its functions including direct access to machine level hardware APIs
It is a highly portable language
Data structure and algorithm can be better implemented in C language, as you can see in my Data Structures and Algorithms Course Playlist.
C is being used to support other programming languages to enhance their efficiency.
Scope:
Let’s talk about the scope of C, so you may know that you are not wasting for time with this Playlist. C has a wide range of scope

Windows, Linux, Mac all are mostly written in C. Linux is written 97% using C.
C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.
MySQL database is written using C.
Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.
Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.
Embedded Systems are created using C
Control:
C gives most of the control in the hand of users. Things like memory allocation and manipulation are totally in the hands of the programmer. Being a flexible language, it provides more access to the programmer because of which it is more efficient.

All of these reasons make C one of the widely used Programming language having special respect in the heart of programmers.

Summary:
C is not a hard language to learn and along with that it stills has a scope in the future. It is a low-level programming language that makes it more efficient and swifter. So many devices and applications are build completely or partially using C, so there is a wide range of options related to field you want to get into.

What is coding?
If we look at the definition i.e. “ coding is the ability to write computer programs”. The definition explains nothing at all, so I am going to explain you in simple words. Coding is a way of communication with the computer. As we know that computer is a dumb machine and it can not work properly until it is provided with instructions. Instructions to the computer are provided using different languages in order for it to do specific tasks.

We have different options i.e. languages through which we can communicate through computer, some of which are low level, that are closer to computer’s understanding i.e. Machine language or C and some are high level that required more processing time in order to transfer the commands or instructions to computer hardware i.e. Python.

Programming or coding is an act of telling the computer, what to do? Without it computer is useless. Programming Languages makes it easier for us to communicate to computer because they work as an intermediary language that both computers and humans can understand.

In 2nd phase we are briefly going to cover the history of C.

History:
C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. At that time, he was working at bell laboratories of AT&T. AT&T is an American multinational conglomerate holding company. It wasn’t the first programming language as before it B, BCPL were being used but there we a lot of problems related to those language and they weren’t that much easier to use. After the introduction of C in the tech industry, it soon got fame without any promotion or advertisement of any sort and till now it is being used widely.

The third thing we will be discussing in this tutorial is our Course and its designed.

Course Content:
This is a unique course as this is specially designed keeping in mind the welfare of the viewer. This course is going to help you the most if you see it in sequence as all of the videos are designed in a way that will start you off from a beginner’s level and take you to an expert level.

The starting topics are easy and simple such as data types, operators, if else statements, etc. but yet well explained as they are the basis of the language. Then we move on to the intermediate topics such as Strings, Arrays or pointers and at the end we will move towards the most advance topics such as File I/O or Function Pointers, etc.

There are also a lot of exercise included in these tutorials, so you might test your skills or learnings and can also evaluate your performance.

Summary:
This course is going to make you an expert level C programmer if you take it seriously and it is also going to help you with other languages as C++, which is very much like C. If you have learned C than you have learned about 60-70% C++. It will also help you with Python as moving towards a simpler language is more easier.
